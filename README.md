# Project-Archive
Collection of projects from previous studio and programming classes.


## Programming 1 Final - S2

For this project I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create an interactive story game, playable directly in a browser. Through this project I learned how to use HTML in conjustion with Javascript coding to enhance both sides as a medium. Originally I planned on mechanics of the game to be much deeper. For example, I planned on the player being able to pick up and store objects, only for them to be usefull later on. Ultimately I realized that my coding method - using javascript to link the html files together - wouldn't allow for this kind of system, as the javascript variables reset on each loading of a new page. If I did this project again I would work on a method to have the javascript update a single html page to solve this problem. Still, I'm satisfied with what I was able to accomplish, It's a simple game, but I was able to give it quite a bit of personality and humor, as well as a unique win condition of traveling back in time with future information.

## Computing Priciples Final - S1

This project was created with pure javascript coding, creating a simple gallery-style shooting game with a fun twist. This is one of my favorite projects, despite not being much of a fan of coding, it was really fun to strech my legs with a project of my own idea. This project helped me learn how to create reasonable goals and dynamically adjust and test a project on a larger scale. I was inspired by the game SUPERHOT at the time, and it's mechanics of freezing and slowing time. Using the frameRate function, I made a mechanic where the game gets faster after every target shot, with the small freeze after every shot allowing players to combo multiple shots in a row. The end result is very satisfying, but not without flaws or room for improvement. The utilization of frameRate as opposed to a "true" speed handeler means that the game's hit registration feels very inconsistant - your practically required to combo all your shots immidiatly since the game gets way too fast and slippery if you don't. If I were to revisit this project this project I would also impliment a real main menu, a leveling system, and a way to retry the game without manually reloading it. I've learned a lot more since this project so a retool isn't out of the question - I really like where I went on this.

## Hardware/Networking Video Project - S2

This project was built with Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects to create an information video on peer-to-peer connections. This prject helped me learn how to efficiently use that software to bring a vision of information to life. I spent quite a bit of time on this project as the topic interested me and I wanted to see what I could accomplish on an unfimulair medium. While I'm satisfied with the visuals of this project theres a definetly a large lack of polish which I would work on if I ever revisited it. The voice over in particular is... rough. I was tired when I did it, and didn't know how or where to effiectly record it. I added the subtitles as it was requirement to even understand the video. Still, I learned a decent amount on this project, both from a technical aspect and creative one.

## Studio 1 - After Effects Project - S1

This project was built in Adobe After Effects. The premise for this project was "create a spooky scene", and I believe I executed that idea flawlessly. From the wildly inconsistant audio levels to the whopping 9gb file size (I didn't know how to export correctly), this project was incredibly scary. Jokes aside, I learned a lot from this small project, It was my first time really using any of the adobe video software, From using keyframes to layering assets and importing audio. I'm happy with the fun video I was able to pull together with this project, even if I would redo almost everything if I were to revist it.

## Face Animation - Studio II - S2

This was a small gif I put together in Studio 2 while tinkering with adobe animate. Not much else to add, but I included it since it's one of the few projects done directly in Studio II
