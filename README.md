## Programming 1 Final

For this project I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create an interactive story game, playable directly in a browser. Through this project I learned how to use HTML in conjustion with Javascript coding to enhance both sides as a medium. Originally I planned on mechanics of the game to be much deeper. For example, I planned on the player being able to pick up and store objects, only for them to be usefull later on. Ultimately I realized that my coding method - using javascript to link the html files together - wouldn't allow for this kind of system, as the javascript variables reset on each loading of a new page. If I did this project again I would work on a method to have the javascript update a single html page to solve this problem. Still, I'm satisfied with what I was able to accomplish, It's a simple game, but I was able to give it quite a bit of personality and humor, as well as a unique win condition of traveling back in time with future information.

## Computing Priciples Final

This project was created with pure javascript coding, creating a simple gallery-style shooting game with a fun twist. This is one of my favorite projects, despite not being much of a fan of coding, it was really fun to strech my legs with a project of my own idea. This project helped me learn how to create reasonable goals and dynamically adjust and test a project on a larger scale. I was inspired by the game SUPERHOT at the time, and it's mechanics of freezing and slowing time. Using the frameRate function, I made a mechanic where the game gets faster after every target shot, with the small freeze after every shot allowing players to combo multiple shots in a row. The end result is very satisfying, but not without flaws or room for improvement. The utilization of frameRate as opposed to a "true" speed handeler means that the game's hit registration feels very inconsistant - your practically required to combo all your shots immidiatly since the game gets way too fast and slippery if you don't. If I were to revisit this project this project I would also impliment a real main menu, a leveling system, and a way to retry the game without manually reloading it. I've learned a lot more since this project so a retool isn't out of the question - I really like where I went on this.
